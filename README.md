# polynomial_conservation_laws
Computes a basis of the Q-vector space of polynomial conservation laws up to a given degree 
using the kernel of the curl operator

Contains the following Singular (computer algebra system for polynomial computations) libraries:

    polconslaw.lib: A library for computing parametric polynomial conservation laws
    
    genpolconslaw.lib: A library for computing polynomial conservation laws in the generic branch
    
    curl.lib: An auxiliary library for testing if a syzygy is irrotational.

A few examples are present a step by step implementation of the algorithms: 
example6_29.sg, example6_30.sg and bm629.sg to be run using Singular
